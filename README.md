# Retail-Store-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

This project showcases a Retail Store Sales Analysis Dashboard developed in Power BI. It visualizes sales and customer data through key KPIs such as total sales, profit, average order value, and top-selling products. The dashboard includes interactive charts for category-wise, region-wise, and time-based analysis. Slicers and filters allow users to drill down into customer behavior and product performance. By presenting sales patterns and growth trends, this dashboard helps retail managers identify opportunities and make informed business decisions.
